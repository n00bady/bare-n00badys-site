## Description
My personal site, this is the public repo with only the basic site and scripts without any blog posts.

## Requirements
For the shell script `makeblog.sh`  well obviously bash and for the python script `spsg.py`  
python3 of course and these packages:
* `jinja2`  
* `markdown`

## Usage of scripts
The `spsg.py` python script requires a `./posts/` directory in the same folder that holds all your blog posts
in markdown and 2 argumets the first one is the template for the posts and the second one is the template for
the index.
