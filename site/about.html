                <h2>Hello there!</h2>
                <p>
                    You can call me n00bady, as you can guess by the name
                    I chose to go by I am a nobody, an uninderesting, boring
                    person. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This used be a personal blog using jekyll but I abadoned that
                    since last year. For some reason perhaps out of boredom I 
                    decided to make a completely new site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I don't like talking about me, following are 
                    some stuff I like. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Computer Stuff</h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned a lot of languages over the years(not to a pro level but enough to get by) 
                    but the ones I prefer to use are C, Rust and Python. I dislike languaged that can only be used
                    to write in one style like Java. Most languages have their place so if I have to I'll use
                    whatever fits best. And of course as you can see from this site my webdev skills
                    are poor at best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I am interested in cybersec and electronics, but I haven't do any of that for 
                    a while now.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Visual Media</h2>
                <p>
                    I watch whatever crap I find when I am bored, I have watched and
                    wasted so many hours watching soykaf series and movies especially
                    when I was younger. I hope some day to take some of those hours
                    back...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from all the crap I wasted my time on some of my favorites series are 
                    Star Trek specifically TNG, The Stargate series (mostly SG1) and more 
                    recently The Expanse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From Animu my all time favorites are Ghost in the shell, Akira, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
                    and Serial Experiments Lain obviously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't read a lot of mango but from the few I read I really liked GANTZ,
                    Magician and BLAME!. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I skipped movies because I don't really have favorite movies, I like 
                    the classics and I mostly enjoy watching sci-fi and fantasy genres.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to music I like variety, I listen to anything from classical to traditional
                    to rock and metal to chillhop to lofi to... you get the point. What I listen to depends
                    on my mood and the time of day. The only think I dislike is most of todays rap and related
                    genres and pop.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Othe Stuff</h2>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy consuming content about technology (in all areas but mostly in computing and space/astronomy), 
                    paranormal and conspiracies.
